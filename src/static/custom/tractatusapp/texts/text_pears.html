<div class="pmc">An analogy to illustrate the concept of truth: imagine a black spot on white paper: you can describe the shape of the spot by saying, for each point on the sheet, whether it is black or white. To the fact that a point is black there corresponds a positive fact, and to the fact that a point is white (not black), a negative fact. If I designate a point on the sheet (a truth-value according to Frege), then this corresponds to the supposition that is put forward for judgement, etc. etc.</div>
<div class="pmc">But in order to be able to say that a point is black or white, I must first know when a point is called black, and when white: in order to be able to say, ‘“<var>p</var>” is true (or false)’, I must have determined in what circumstances I call ‘<var>p</var>’ true, and in so doing I determine the sense of the proposition.</div>
<div class="pmc">Now the point where the simile breaks down is this: we can indicate a point on the paper even if we do not know what black and white are, but if a proposition has no sense, nothing corresponds to it, since it does not designate a thing (a truth-value) which might have properties called ‘false’ or ‘true’. The verb of a proposition is not ‘is true’ or ‘is false’, as Frege thought: rather, that which ‘is true’ must already contain the verb.</div>

<div class="pmc">We can now talk about formal concepts, in the same sense that we speak of formal properties.</div>
<div class="pmc">(I introduce this expression in order to exhibit the source of the confusion between formal concepts and concepts proper, which pervades the whole of traditional logic.)</div>
<div class="pmc">When something falls under a formal concept as one of its objects, this cannot be expressed by means of a proposition. Instead it is shown in the very sign for this object. (A name shows that it signifies an object, a sign for a number that it signifies a number, etc.)</div>
<div class="pmc">Formal concepts cannot, in fact, be represented by means of a function, as concepts proper can.</div>
<div class="pmc">For their characteristics, formal properties, are not expressed by means of functions.</div>
<div class="pmc">The expression for a formal property is a feature of certain symbols.</div>
<div class="pmc">So the sign for the characteristics of a formal concept is a distinctive feature of all symbols whose meanings fall under the concept.</div>
<div class="pmc">So the expression for a formal concept is a propositional variable in which this distinctive feature alone is constant.</div>

<div class="pmc">Thus the variable name ‘<var>x</var>’ is the proper sign for the pseudo-concept <em>object</em>.</div>
<div class="pmc">Wherever the word ‘object’ (‘thing’, etc.) is correctly used, it is expressed in conceptual notation by a variable name.</div>
<div class="pmc">For example, in the proposition, ‘There are 2 objects which …’, it is expressed by ‘<span class="quant">(<span class="symbol">∃</span><var>x</var>,<var>y</var>)</span>…’.</div>
<div class="pmc">Wherever it is used in a different way, that is as a proper concept-word, nonsensical pseudo-propositions are the result.</div>
<div class="pmc">So one cannot say, for example, ‘There are objects’, as one might say, ‘There are books’. And it is just as impossible to say, ‘There are 100 objects’, or, ‘There are <span class="symbol">ℵ</span><sub>0</sub> objects’.</div>
<div class="pmc">And it is nonsensical to speak of the <em>total number of objects</em>.</div>
<div class="pmc">The same applies to the words ‘complex’, ‘fact’, ‘function’, ‘number’, etc.</div>
<div class="pmc">They all signify formal concepts, and are represented in conceptual notation by variables, not by functions or classes (as Frege and Russell believed).</div>
<div class="pmc">‘1 is a number’, ‘There is only one zero’, and all similar expressions are nonsensical.</div>
<div class="pmc">(It is just as nonsensical to say, ‘There is only one 1’, as it would be to say, ‘2<span class="mathrel">+</span>2 at 3 o’clock equals 4’.)</div>

<div class="pmc">A formal concept is given immediately any object falling under it is given. It is not possible, therefore, to introduce as primitive ideas objects belonging to a formal concept <em>and</em> the formal concept itself.

<div class="pmc">In order to recognize an expression as a tautology, in cases where no generality-sign occurs in it, one can employ the following intuitive method: instead of ‘<var>p</var>’, ‘<var>q</var>’, ‘<var>r</var>’, etc. I write ‘<span class="mathrm">T</span><var class="doublepushvar">p</var><span class="mathrm">F</span>’, ‘<span class="mathrm">T</span><var class="doublepushvar">q</var><span class="mathrm">F</span>’, ‘<span class="mathrm">T</span><var class="doublepushvar">r</var><span class="mathrm">F</span>’, etc. Truth-combinations I express by means of brackets, e.g.</div>

<div class="pmc">This throws some light on the question why logical propositions cannot be confirmed by experience any more than they can be refuted by it.

<div class="pmc">The general validity of logic might be called essential, in contrast with the accidental general validity of such propositions as ‘All men are mortal’.

<div class="pmc">The propositions of logic describe the scaffolding of the world, or rather they represent it. They have no ‘subject-matter’. They presuppose that names have meaning and elementary propositions sense; and that is their connexion with the world. It is clear that something about the world must be indicated by the fact that certain combinations of symbols—whose essence involves the possession of a determinate character—are tautologies. This contains the decisive point. We have said that some things are arbitrary in the symbols that we use and that some things are not. In logic it is only the latter that express: but that means that logic is not a field in which <em>we</em> express what we wish with the help of signs, but rather one in which the nature of the natural and inevitable signs speaks for itself. If we know the logical syntax of any sign-language, then we have already been given all the propositions of logic.</div>

<div class="pmc">Newtonian mechanics, for example, imposes a unified form on the description of the world. Let us imagine a white surface with irregular black spots on it. We then say that whatever kind of picture these make, I can always approximate as closely as I wish to the description of it by covering the surface with a sufficiently fine square mesh, and then saying of every square whether it is black or white. In this way I shall have imposed a unified form on the description of the surface. The form is optional, since I could have achieved the same result by using a net with a triangular or hexagonal mesh. Possibly the use of a triangular mesh would have made the description simpler: that is to say, it might be that we could describe the surface more accurately with a coarse triangular mesh than with a fine square mesh (or conversely), and so on. The different nets correspond to different systems for describing the world. Mechanics determines one form of description of the world by saying that all propositions used in the description of the world must be obtained in a given way from a given set of propositions—the axioms of mechanics. It thus supplies the bricks for building the edifice of science, and it says, ‘Any building that you want to erect, whatever it may be, must somehow be constructed with these bricks, and with these alone.’</div>

<div class="pmc">And now we can see the relative position of logic and mechanics. (The net might also consist of more than one kind of mesh: e.g. we could use both triangles and hexagons.) The possibility of describing a picture like the one mentioned above with a net of a given form tells us <em>nothing</em> about the picture. (For that is true of all such pictures.) But what <em>does</em> characterize the picture is that it can be described <em>completely</em> by a particular net with a <em>particular</em> size of mesh.</div>
<div class="pmc">Similarly the possibility of describing the world by means of Newtonian mechanics tells us nothing about the world: but what does tell us something about it is the precise <em>way</em> in which it is possible to describe it by these means. We are also told something about the world by the fact that it can be described more simply with one system of mechanics than with another.</div>

<div class="pmc">When an ethical law of the form, ‘Thou shalt …’ is laid down, one’s first thought is, ‘And what if I do not do it?’ It is clear, however, that ethics has nothing to do with punishment and reward in the usual sense of the terms. So our question about the <em>consequences</em> of an action must be unimportant.—At least those consequences should not be events. For there must be something right about the question we posed. There must indeed be some kind of ethical reward and ethical punishment, but they must reside in the action itself.</div>
<div class="pmc">(And it is also clear that the reward must be something pleasant and the punishment something unpleasant.)</div>

<div class="pmc">It is impossible to speak about the will in so far as it is the subject of ethical attributes.</div>

<div class="pmc">If the good or bad exercise of the will does alter the world, it can alter only the limits of the world, not the facts—not what can be expressed by means of language.</div>

<div class="pmc">Not only is there no guarantee of the temporal immortality of the human soul, that is to say of its eternal survival after death; but, in any case, this assumption completely fails to accomplish the purpose for which it has always been intended.

<div class="pmc">The correct method in philosophy would really be the following: to say nothing except what can be said, i.e. propositions of natural science—i.e. something that has nothing to do with philosophy—and then, whenever someone else wanted to say something metaphysical, to demonstrate to him that he had failed to give a meaning to certain signs in his propositions. Although it would not be satisfying to the other person—he would not have the feeling that we were teaching him philosophy—<em>this</em> method would be the only strictly correct one.</div>
